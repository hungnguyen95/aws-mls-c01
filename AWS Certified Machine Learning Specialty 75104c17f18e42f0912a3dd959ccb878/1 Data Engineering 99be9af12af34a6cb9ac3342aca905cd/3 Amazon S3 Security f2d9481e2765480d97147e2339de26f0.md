# 3. Amazon S3 Security

- There are 4 methods of encrypting objects in S3
    - SSE-S3: encrypts S3 objects using keys handled & managed by AWS
    - SSE-KMS: use AWS Key Management Service to manage encryption keys
        - Additional security (user must have access to KMS key)
        - Audit trail for KMS key usage
    - SSE-C: when you want to manage your own encryption keys
    - Client Side Encryption

- **From an ML perspective, SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS will be most likely used**

## SSE-S3

## SSE-KMS

## S3 Security

- User based
    - IAM policies - which API calls should be allowed for a specific user

- Resource Based
    - Bucket Policies - bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account
    - Object Access Control List (ACL) – finer grain
    - Bucket Access Control List (ACL) – less common

---

## S3 Bucket Policies

- JSON based policies
    - Resources: buckets and objects
    - Actions: Set of API to Allow or Deny
    - Effect: Allow / Deny
    - Principal: The account or user to apply the policy to

- Use S3 bucket for policy to:
    - Grant public access to the bucket
    - Force objects to be encrypted at upload
    - Grant access to another account (Cross Account)

## S3 Default Encryption vs Bucket Policies

- The old way to enable default encryption was to use a bucket policy and refuse any HTTP command without the proper headers:

- The new way is to use the “default encryption” option in S3
- Note: Bucket Policies are evaluated before “default encryption”

## S3 Security - Other

- Networking - **VPC Endpoint Gateway:**
    - Allow traffic to stay within your VPC (instead of going through public web)
    - Make sure your private services (AWS SageMaker) can access S3
    - **Very important for AWS ML Exam**

- Logging and Audit:
    - S3 access logs can be stored in other S3 bucket
    - API calls can be logged in AWS CloudTrail

- Tagged Based (combined with IAM policies and bucket policies)
    - Example: Add tag Classification=PHI to your objects (restrict some user can access this object based on tag, can use IAM and bucket policies to restrict)
