# 16. TF-IDF

## TF-IDF

- Stands for Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency
- Important data for search – figures out what terms are most relevant for a document
- Sounds fancy!

## TF-IDF Explained

- Term Frequency just measures how often a word occurs in a document
    - A word that occurs frequently is probably important to that document’s meaning
- Document Frequency is how often a word occurs in an entire set of documents, i.e., all of Wikipedia or every web page
    - This tells us about common words that just appear everywhere no matter what the topic, like “a”, “the”, “and”, etc
- So a measure of the relevancy of a word to a document might be: $\frac{Term Frequency}{Document Frequency}$

    Or: Term Frequency * Inverse Document Frequency

That is, take how often the word appears in a document, over how often it just appears everywhere. That gives you a measure of how important and unique this word is for this document

## TF-IDF In Practice

- We actually use the log of the IDF, since word frequencies are distributed exponentially. That gives us a better weighting of a words overall popularity
- TF-IDF assumes a document is just a “bag of words”
    - Parsing documents into a bag of words can be most of the work
    - Words can be represented as a hash value (number) for efficiency
    - What about synonyms? Various tenses? Abbreviations? Capitalizations? Misspellings?
- Doing this at scale is the hard part
    - That’s where Spark comes in!

## Unigrams, bigrams, etc

- An extension of TF-IDF is to not only compute relevancy for individual words (terms) but also for bi-grams or, more generally, n-grams.
- “I love certification exams"
    - Unigrams: “I”, “love”, “certification”, “exams”
    - Bi-grams: “I love”, “love certification”, “certification exams”
    - Tri-grams: “I love certification”, “love certification exams”

## Using TF-IDF

- A very simple search algorithm could be:
    - Compute TF-IDF for every word in a corpus
    - For a given search word, sort the documents by their TF-IDF score for that word
    - Display the results
