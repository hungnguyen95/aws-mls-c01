# 1. Types of Data

## Numerical

- Represents some sort of quantitative measurement
    - Heights of people, page load times, stock prices, etc.

- Discrete Data
    - Integer based; often counts of some event.
        - How many purchases did a customer make in a year?
        - How many times did I flip “heads”?

- Continuous Data
    - Has an infinite number of possible values
        - How much time did it take for a user to check out?
        - How much rain fell on a given day?

## Categorical

- Qualitative data that has no inherent mathematical meaning
    - Gender, Yes/no (binary data), Race, State of Residence, Product Category, Political Party, etc.
- You can assign numbers to categories in order to represent them more compactly, but the numbers don’t have mathematical meaning

## Ordinal

- A mixture of numerical and categorical
- Categorical data that has mathematical meaning
- Example: movie ratings on a 1-5 scale.
    - Ratings must be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5
    - But these values have mathematical meaning; 1 means it’s a worse movie than a 2
