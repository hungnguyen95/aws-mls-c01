# 15. SageMaker Ground Truth

## What is Ground Truth?

- Sometimes you don’t have training data at all, and it needs to be generated by humans first.
- Example: training an image classification model. Somebody needs to tag a bunch of images with  what they are images of before training a neural network
- Ground Truth manages humans who will label your data for training purposes

## But it’s more than that

- Ground Truth creates its own model as images are labeled by people
- As this model learns, only images the model isn’t sure about are sent to human labelers
- This can reduce the cost of labeling jobs by 70%
