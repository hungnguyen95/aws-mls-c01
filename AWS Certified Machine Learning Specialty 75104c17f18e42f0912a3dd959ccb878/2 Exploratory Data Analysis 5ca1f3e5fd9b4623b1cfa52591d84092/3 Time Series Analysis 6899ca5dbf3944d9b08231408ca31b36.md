## Noise

- Some variations are just random in nature
- Seasonality + Trends + Noise = time series
    - Additive model
    - Seasonal variation is constant

- Or sometimes, seasonality * trends * noise â€“ trends sometimes amplify seasonality and noise
    - Multiplicative model
    - Seasonal variation increases as the trend increases
