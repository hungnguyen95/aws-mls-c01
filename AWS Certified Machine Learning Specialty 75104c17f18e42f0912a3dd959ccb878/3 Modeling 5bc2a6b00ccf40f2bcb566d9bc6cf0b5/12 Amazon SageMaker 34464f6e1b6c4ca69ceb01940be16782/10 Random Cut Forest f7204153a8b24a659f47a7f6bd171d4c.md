# 10. Random Cut Forest

## Random Cut Forest: Whatâ€™s it for?

- Anomaly detection
- Unsupervised
- Detect unexpected spikes in time series data
- Breaks in periodicity
- Unclassifiable data points
- Assigns an anomaly score to each data point
- Based on an algorithm developed by Amazon that they seem to be very proud of!

## Random Cut Forest: What training input does it expect?

- RecordIO-protobuf or CSV
- Can use File or Pipe mode on either
- Optional test channel for computing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 on labeled data (anomaly or not)

---

## Random Cut Forest: How is it used?

- Creates a forest of trees where each tree is a partition of the training data; looks at expected change in complexity of the tree as a result of adding a point into it
- Data is sampled randomly
- Then trained
- RCF shows up in Kinesis Analytics as well; it can work on streaming data too.

## Random Cut Forest: Important Hyperparameters

- Num_trees
    - Increasing reduces noise
- Num_samples_per_tree
    - Should be chosen such that `1/num_samples_per_tree` approximates the ratio of anomalous to normal data

## Random Cut Forest: Instance Types

- Does not take advantage of GPUs
- Use M4, C4, or C5 for training
- ml.c5.xl for inference
