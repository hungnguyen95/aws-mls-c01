# 17. IP Insights

## IP Insights: What’s it for?

- Unsupervised learning of IP address usage patterns
- Identifies suspicious behavior from IP addresses
    - Identify logins from anomalous IP’s
    - Identify accounts creating resources from anomalous IP’s

---

## IP Insights: What training input does it expect?

- User names, account ID’s can be fed in directly; no need to pre-process
- Training channel, optional validation (computes AUC score)
- CSV only
    - Entity, IP

---

## IP Insights: How is it used?

- Uses a neural network to learn latent vector representations of entities and IP addresses.
- Entities are hashed and embedded
    - Need sufficiently large hash size
- Automatically generates negative samples during training by randomly pairing entities and IP’s

---

## IP Insights: Important Hyperparameters

- Num_entity_vectors
    - Hash size
    - Set to twice the number of unique entity identifiers
- Vector_dim
    - Size of embedding vectors
    - Scales model size
    - Too large results in overfitting
- Epochs, learning rate, batch size, etc.

## IP Insights: Instance Types

- CPU or GPU
    - GPU recommended
    - Ml.p3.2xlarge or higher
    - Can use multiple GPU’s
    - Size of CPU instance depends on vector_dim and num_entity_vectors
