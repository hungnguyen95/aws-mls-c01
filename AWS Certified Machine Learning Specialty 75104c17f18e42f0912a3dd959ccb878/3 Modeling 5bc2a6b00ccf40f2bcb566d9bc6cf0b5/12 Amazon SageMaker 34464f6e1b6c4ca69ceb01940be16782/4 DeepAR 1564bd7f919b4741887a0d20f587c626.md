# 4. DeepAR

## DeepAR: What’s it for?

- Forecasting one-dimensional time series data
- Uses RNN’s
- Allows you to train the same model over several related time series
- Finds frequencies and seasonality

---

## DeepAR: What training input does it expect?

- JSON lines format
    - Gzip or Parquet
- Each record must contain:
    - Start: the starting time stamp
    - Target: the time series values
- Each record can contain:
    - Dynamic_feat: dynamic features (such as, was a promotion applied to a product in a time series of product purchases)
    - Cat: categorical features

```python
{"start": "2009-11-01 00:00:00", "target": [4.3, "NaN", 5.1, ...], "cat": [0, 1], "dynamic_feat": [[1.1, 1.2, 0.5, ...]]}
{"start": "2012-01-30 00:00:00", "target": [1.0, -5.0, ...], "cat": [2, 3], "dynamic_feat": [[1.1, 2.05, ...]]}
{"start": "1999-01-30 00:00:00", "target": [2.0, 1.0], "cat": [1, 4], "dynamic_feat": [[1.3, 0.4]]}
```

## DeepAR: How is it used?

- Always include entire time series for training, testing, and inference
- Use entire dataset as training set, remove last time points for testing. Evaluate on withheld values.
- Don’t use very large values for prediction length (> 400)
- Train on many time series and not just one when possible

---

## DeepAR: Important Hyperparameters

- Context_length
    - Number of time points the model sees before making a prediction
    - Can be smaller than seasonalities; the model will lag one year anyhow.
- Epochs
- mini_batch_size
- Learning_rate
- Num_cells

## DeepAR: Instance Types

- Can use CPU or GPU
- Single or multi machine
- Start with CPU (C4.2xlarge, C4.4xlarge)
- Move up to GPU if necessary
- Only helps with larger models
- CPU-only for inference
- May need larger instances for tuning
