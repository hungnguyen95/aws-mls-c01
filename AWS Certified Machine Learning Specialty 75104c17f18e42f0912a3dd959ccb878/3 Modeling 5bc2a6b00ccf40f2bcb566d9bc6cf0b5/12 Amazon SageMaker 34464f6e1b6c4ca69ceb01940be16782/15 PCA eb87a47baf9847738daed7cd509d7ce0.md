# 15. PCA

## PCA: What’s it for?

- Principal Component Analysis

- Dimensionality reduction
    - Project higher-dimensional data (lots of features) into lower-dimensional (like a 2D plot) while minimizing loss of information
    - The reduced dimensions are called components
        - First component has largest possible variability
        - Second component has the next largest…

- Unsupervised

---

## PCA: What training input does it expect?

- recordIO-protobuf or CSV
- File or Pipe on either

---

## PCA: How is it used?

- Covariance matrix is created, then singular value decomposition (SVD)
- Two modes
    - Regular
        - For sparse data and moderate number of observations and features
    - Randomized
        - For large number of observations and features
        - Uses approximation algorithm

## PCA: Important Hyperparameters

- Algorithm_mode
- Subtract_mean
    - Unbias data

---

## PCA: Instance Types

- GPU or CPU
    - It depends “on the specifics of the input data”
