# AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty

This note is structured into the four domains tested by this exam: *data engineering, exploratory data analysis, modeling,* and *machine learning implementation and operations*. Just some of the topics I'll cover include:

- **S3** data lakes
- AWS **Glue** and Glue ETL
- **Kinesis** data streams, firehose, and video streams
- **DynamoDB**
- Data Pipelines, AWS Batch, and Step Functions
- Using **scikit_learn**
- Data science basics
- **Athena** and **Quicksight**
- Elastic MapReduce (**EMR**)
- Apache **Spark** and MLLib
- **Feature engineering** (imputation, outliers, binning, transforms, encoding, and normalization)
- Ground Truth
- **Deep Learning** basics
- Tuning neural networks and avoiding overfitting
- Amazon **SageMaker**, in depth
- Regularization techniques
- Evaluating machine learning models (precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix, etc.)
- High-level ML services: **Comprehend**, **Translate**, **Polly**, **Transcribe**, **Lex**, **Rekognition**, and more
- **Security** best practices with machine learning on AWS

### **What you’ll learn**

- What to expect on the AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty exam
- Amazon SageMaker's built-in machine learning algorithms (XGBoost, BlazingText, Object Detection, etc.)
- Feature engineering techniques, including imputation, outliers, binning, and normalization
- High-level ML services: Comprehend, Translate, Polly, Transcribe, Lex, Rekognition, and more
- Data engineering with S3, Glue, Kinesis, and DynamoDB
- Exploratory data analysis with scikit_learn, Athena, Apache Spark, and EMR
- Deep learning and hyperparameter tuning of deep neural networks
- Automatic model tuning and operations with SageMaker
- L1 and L2 regularization
- Applying security best practices to machine learning pipelines

### **Are there any course requirements or prerequisites?**

- Associate-level knowledge of AWS services such as EC2
- Some existing familiarity with machine learning
- An AWS account is needed to perform the hands-on lab exercises

### **Who this course is for:**

- Individuals performing a development or data science role seeking certification in machine learning and AWS.
